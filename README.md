# Wordcloud-Covid-Analysis

Word Cloud is a visualization technique for text data wherein each word is picturized with its importance in the context or its frequency. 

# Objective:
To help clinicians know more about which symptoms of Covid are most frequent among patients in the dataset and then visualize it with the help of a word cloud. Initial data cleaning was done on Google Colab and further explored with the help of Pandas Library. A couple of cleaning methods were applied and the outputs were generated to be downloaded as the final file. 

## Tools used:
Google Colab, Python

Once initial data cleaning was done in python both the Word cloud library and matplotlib libraries were imported to help in visualizing the generated plots

There were three primary steps in building a word cloud:
1. Extract the symptoms column (text column)
2. Create and generate a wordcloud image
3. Display the frequency using matplotlib
